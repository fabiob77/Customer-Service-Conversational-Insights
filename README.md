# Customer Service Conversational Insights

## Knowledge Mining applied to Conversations

Every day a large amount of data is generated by Customer Services in the form of Natural Language conversations with customers. This data is stored as chat logs (with human agents or bots) or audio recordings from voice-based calls.

This is typically unstructured data that, if processed, can result in a great amount of insights for Contact Centers, add additional data to NBA models and provide a better view of the customer.

The Customer Service Conversational Insights is a solution accelerator built on top of Cognitive Search, Bot Framework, LUIS-D and Text Analytics that allows customers to quickly deploy an integrated platform and immediately start extracting insights from customer conversations.
